# WASM

JavaScript is a nice language and I quite like the latest versions of it. It's even more nice if you spice it up a little bit writing TypeScript instead.
It's a perfect tool when it comes to interactions with the user in the webapp. The community is huge, 
I seem can't remember anything which didn't already had a library as an npm package. Most of those packages include both nodejs support, as well as can work in the browser (or you can find an alternative).
However, recently I found the case, where there was nothing reusable as a lib. Perhaps not that many people need that after all? Or it might be, that JS isn't that good and convenient when it comes to low-level byte manipulations,
cryptography or something like that? The need I had was the SSH client. Right from the browser. I had a working example written in the Go and thought - "Ha, WASM should be the good solution for the problem, right?". That wasn't actually that easy after all, but I learned a thing or two and would like to share it here.

## What to expect from the article

I wouldn't share the full working client just yet, as it seems not really an important part here, but the WASM journey itself. So I will guide through the most important steps to get such project to life.
Spoiler alert: you still have to have some kind of a server with WebSocket support, so it might be better to avoid this path altogether, but I'll share some requirements we had that forced us to have both wasm ssh client and still the server part.

## Some projects I started the research from

https://github.com/billchurch/webssh2/
https://ssheasy.com/ (https://github.com/hullarb/ssheasy) Looks like the kind of a project we would like to have, but the code can't be used in any way, so we had to work from scratch

Some random project loading wasm not the way many do: https://github.com/withastro/compiler/blob/main/packages/compiler/src/browser/index.ts

Still manual deployment
